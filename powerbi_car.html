        <!-- Section: Overview -->
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This dashboard analyzes Malaysia’s automotive market using official car registration data 
            from <strong>data.gov.my</strong> and <strong>car price data scraped using ChatGPT</strong>. 
            The project demonstrates end-to-end data preparation, data modelling, DAX measure creation, 
            and interactive visual storytelling with Power BI.
        </p>

        <!-- Section: Maximum Car Prices -->
        <h2>Maximum Car Prices by Model</h2>
        <p>
            The dashboard highlights the <strong>highest recorded prices</strong> across major manufacturers 
            such as BYD, Proton, Honda, and Perodua.  
            This helps users quickly identify premium models and understand how EVs, sedans, SUVs, 
            and compact cars compare across price segments.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pricing data also reveals how <strong>EV models (especially BYD)</strong> occupy the upper end 
            of the price spectrum, showing the shift towards high-value electric vehicles entering Malaysia’s market.
        </p>

        <!-- Section: Fuel Type & Colour Preferences -->
        <h2>Fuel Type & Colour Preferences</h2>
        <p>
            The dashboard presents a breakdown of car registrations by <strong>colour</strong> and, where applicable, 
            <strong>fuel category</strong> (EV vs petrol).  
            Key observations include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>White, silver, and black remain the most dominant colours nationwide.</li>
            <li>EV models tend to favour neutral or futuristic colour themes.</li>
            <li>Compact cars show the widest colour variation, especially in Perodua models.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These insights help manufacturers and marketers better understand consumer preferences.
        </p>
